	 * Pattern selection:
	 * ==================
	 * 
	 * The language core (CML language) provides a Published Language (PL) allowing to describe software systems
	 * in terms of DDD patterns. This PL is used by the other components. Since its not a public API (REST, Messaging, 
	 * or similar) we haven't added the Open Host Service (OHS) pattern.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * The discovery library conforms to the model provided by the language core (we always generate CML models
	 * according to the core). The generators and Service Cutter integration (structured service decomposition) 
	 * on the other hand may also influence the language sometimes.
